# 🔧 Fix Applied: Tool Execution Lookup Issue

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**
When you saved a tool using the form, it was stored in the **state plugin**, but when you tried to play it, the `executeRegisteredTool` function was still looking in the old **local `registeredTools` Map**.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Updated `executeRegisteredTool` Function**
Now it checks both storage locations:
```javascript
// Check state plugin first, then fallback to local registeredTools Map
let tool;
if (window.haloStatePlugin) {
  tool = window.haloStatePlugin.getTool(toolId);
  if (tool) {
    logToWorkflowOutput(`🔍 Found tool in state plugin: ${tool.name}`);
  }
}

// Fallback to local storage if not found in state plugin
if (!tool) {
  tool = registeredTools.get(toolId);
  if (tool) {
    logToWorkflowOutput(`🔍 Found tool in local storage: ${tool.name}`);
  }
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Debug Information**
Added comprehensive logging to show:
- Where the tool was found (state plugin vs local storage)
- List of available tools in both locations when tool is not found

### **3. Updated Response Actions**
Fixed the `executeResponseAction` function to use the same dual-lookup logic for tool chaining.

### **4. Added Debug Function**
New `debugToolStorage()` function to help troubleshoot tool storage issues.

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Quick Test:**
1. **Refresh the page** to load the updated code
2. **Create a tool** using the form and save it
3. **Click the play button** - it should now work!

### **Debug Commands:**
Run these in the browser console if you have issues:
```javascript
// Check tool storage
debugToolStorage();

// Manual tool execution test
executeRegisteredTool('your_tool_id_here');
```

## 🎉 **Expected Result**
Now when you click the play button on a saved tool, you should see:
- `🔍 Found tool in state plugin: [Tool Name]`
- The tool should execute successfully instead of showing "not found"

The tool execution will now work for tools saved through the form! 🚀
